# Agentic QA Platform Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for an agentic platform designed to perform Quality Assurance (QA) on web applications.

## 1. Vision

To create an AI-powered platform that can understand and execute tests on web applications based on natural language, learn the application's features, and eventually suggest its own test cases, thereby streamlining the QA process.

## 2. Platform Preferences

*   **Backend:** Python
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB (The system should be designed to be flexible with the database choice).
*   **Model Agnosticism:** The core logic should be independent of any specific Large Language Model (LLM). It should be possible to switch between models like GPT-4, Claude, Llama, etc., with minimal changes.

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1. Test Definition Ingestion

*   The system must accept test definitions in a Gherkin-like format.
*   Users will provide a high-level feature description and a set of scenarios.
*   **Example:**
    ```gherkin
    Feature: User Authentication

      Scenario: Successful login
        Given I am on the login page
        When I enter valid credentials
        And I click the "Login" button
        Then I should be redirected to the dashboard

      Scenario: Failed login
        Given I am on the login page
        When I enter invalid credentials
        And I click the "Login" button
        Then I should see an error message
    ```

### 3.2. Contextual Understanding

*   The system must be able to incorporate additional context provided by the user.
*   This context can include:
    *   Application URL
    *   Environment details (e.g., staging, production)
    *   Test data (e.g., user credentials, sample inputs)
    *   HTML snippets or component identifiers to help the agent locate elements.

### 3.3. Test Plan Generation

*   Based on the Gherkin-style input and context, the system will generate a detailed test plan.
*   The test plan is a structured representation of the tests to be executed.
*   It should break down each Gherkin step into a series of concrete actions.
*   The test plan should be reviewable and editable by a human QA engineer before execution.

### 3.4. Test Execution Engine

*   The core of the platform, responsible for executing the test plan in an interactive, agentic manner.
*   It will use the **`playwright-mcp`** (Model Context Protocol) server to facilitate direct browser control by the LLM.
*   **Execution Flow:**
    *   The engine will manage a `playwright-mcp` instance.
    *   For each step in the test plan, the engine will provide the LLM with the current page's accessibility snapshot and a set of available browser-control tools.
    *   The LLM will decide which tool to use (e.g., `browser_click`, `browser_type`), and the engine will execute this command via the `playwright-mcp` server.
    *   This creates a dynamic loop where the agent "sees" the page and decides on the next action, rather than following a pre-written, static script.

### 3.5. Reporting and Analytics

*   After execution, the system must generate a comprehensive test report.
*   The report should include:
    *   Pass/Fail status for each step and scenario.
    *   Screenshots and/or videos of the test execution, especially for failed steps.
    *   Logs from the execution engine.
    *   Performance metrics (e.g., page load times).

## 4. Initial Features (Phase 1)

### 4.1. UI for Test Creation and Execution
*   A simple web interface for users to:
    *   Create a new test project.
    *   Input the web application's URL and other context.
    *   Write or paste Gherkin-style test definitions.
    *   Trigger the test plan generation.
    *   Review and approve the test plan.
    *   Initiate the test run.
    *   View test results and reports.

### 4.2. LLM-Driven Interactive Execution
*   An LLM-powered module that interprets Gherkin steps and translates them into live actions using the `playwright-mcp` toolset.
*   Instead of generating a script, the LLM will be prompted at each step to choose the correct tool to achieve the step's goal.
*   **Example Interaction Flow:**
    *   **Instruction:** `Given I am on the login page`
    *   **LLM Chooses Tool:** `browser_navigate(url='https://example.com/login')`
    *   ---
    *   **Instruction:** `When I enter "user@example.com" into the "Email" field`
    *   **LLM Receives Snapshot:** (The model gets the accessibility tree containing a reference, e.g., `ref123`, for the "Email" input field)
    *   **LLM Chooses Tool:** `browser_type(ref='ref123', text='user@example.com', element='Email field')`
    *   ---
    *   **Instruction:** `And I click the "Login" button`
    *   **LLM Receives Snapshot:** (The model gets a new snapshot with a reference, e.g., `ref456`, for the "Login" button)
    *   **LLM Chooses Tool:** `browser_click(ref='ref456', element='Login button')`

### 4.3. Basic Test Plan Management
*   Ability to save, view, and edit test plans.
*   Each test plan is associated with a specific web application and context.

## 5. Future Plans (Phase 2 and Beyond)

### 5.1. Autonomous Exploration
*   Develop an "explore" mode where the agent autonomously navigates the web application.
*   The agent will crawl the application, identifying interactive elements like links, buttons, forms, etc.
*   It will build a model or a map of the application's structure and features.

### 5.2. Test Case Suggestion
*   Based on the exploration phase, the agent will suggest potential test cases.
*   It will identify common patterns (e.g., login forms, search bars, data tables) and generate Gherkin-style tests for them.
*   The system could be fine-tuned to recognize application-specific components and suggest more relevant tests.

### 5.3. Visual Regression Testing
*   Integrate screenshot comparison capabilities.
*   The agent will take baseline screenshots and compare them against subsequent test runs to detect unintended visual changes.

### 5.4. Self-Healing Tests
*   When a test fails due to a change in the UI (e.g., a selector has changed), the agent attempts to find the new selector automatically.
*   This would reduce the maintenance burden of the test suite.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Scalability:** The platform should be able to run multiple tests in parallel.
*   **Security:** All sensitive data (like test credentials) must be stored securely.
*   **Extensibility:** The architecture should allow for easy integration of new tools, models, or testing frameworks.
*   **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive for QA engineers and developers.
